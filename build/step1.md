### Examine Our Assets

In the current directory you'll see two files, a `main.go` and a `Dockerfile`.

`ls`{{execute}}

`main.go` is a simple web server listening on port `8000` that returns text back to the user.

`cat main.go`{{execute}}

`Dockerfile` is our set of instructions that the Docker engine will use to build our image with.

`cat Dockerfile`{{execute}}
